I'm è´¾æƒ å¦¤ Jessie (Huiyu) Jia, a Computer Science major at Cornell University, pursuing minors in Artificial Intelligence and Film. I'm originally from Guangzhou, China, and am now based between Princeton, NJ and Ithaca, NY.

My interests bridge two exciting worlds:

## ðŸ¤– CS, Robotics, and Human-AI Interaction

Watching the movie *HER* got me hooked on thinking about how AI might shape our everyday livesâ€”whether through smart homes, assistant robots, or emotional companions. In my free time, I'm pondering these questions and researching.

I'm passionate about using technology to enhance human experiences, focusing on robotics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and creative computing. My projects range from robot learning in simulation to designing LLM-driven systems for cyberbullying education.

## ðŸŽ¬ Filmmaking and Visual Storytelling

As a filmmaker and videographer, I love crafting visual narratives that resonate emotionally. My favorite roles are behind the cameraâ€”as Director of Photography, Assistant Camera, or Gafferâ€”collaborating closely with directors and writers to realize their creative visions. I've worked on multiple short films submitted to prestigious festivals and produced promotional content for Cornellâ€™s Performing & Media Arts department.

Beyond creating films, I'm an absolute film nerd. You'll often find me wandering through NYC's indie theaters like Metrograph, Film Forum, IFC Center, and Film at Lincoln Center. Follow me on Letterboxd ðŸ‘€: [letterboxd.com/JieC_x](https://letterboxd.com/JieC_x/).

I also love attending and volunteering at film festivals! Spoiler alert: Iâ€™ve already booked my ticket to Cannes 2025 ðŸŽ¬âœ¨.

I'm always looking for projects that sit at the intersection of technology and creative storytelling. Whether it's research, engineering, or filmmaking. Also, if youâ€™re working on any COOL film project, Iâ€™d love to help out!

If we share any of the same passions, I'd love to connect! Feel free to reach out via email or Instagram ðŸ˜Š.
