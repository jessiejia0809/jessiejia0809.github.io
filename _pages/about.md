I'm Jessie (Huiyu) Jia 贾惠妤!  
Computer Science undergrad @ Cornell, minoring in AI & Film.  
From Guangzhou 🇨🇳, now based in Princeton, NJ and Ithaca, NY 🇺🇸 .

## 🤖 Computer Science: Robotics & Human-AI Interaction

Watching *HER* sparked my curiosity about how AI shapes daily life—from smart homes to emotional companions.  <img src='/images/her.png'> <br/>

I love exploring these questions through `robotics`, `human-computer interaction (HCI)`, and creative computing. My project ranges from Sim2Real Robot learning, and building LLM-powered tools for cyberbullying education.

## 🎬 Filmmaking & Visual Storytelling

I work mostly in the camera department 🎥, as `Director of Photography`, `Assistant Camera`, `Gaffer`, crafting emotionally resonant stories. My past works include promotional content for Cornell’s Performing & Media Arts and short films selected for prestigious festivals and .

I'm also a dedicated film nerd—you’ll find me at indie theaters around NYC (Metrograph, IFC Center, Film Forum, Film at Lincoln Center). Follow my film adventures on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/JieC_x/)👀.

✨ Spoiler Alert: I’ve booked my ticket for Cannes 2025 already!
